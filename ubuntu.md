# Rancher Desktop on Ubuntu - Demo

I was looking for a way to easily run a kubernetes cluster on Windows and came across [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

This repo is a way for me to write down how I did it and hopefully help other people who may be interested in doing something similar.

## Pre-Req's

### This is tested on Ubuntu 25.04, but should also work on 24.04

[Ubuntu Desktop] (https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)

Update your desktop install with:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```
