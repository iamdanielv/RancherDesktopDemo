# Rancher Desktop on Ubuntu - Demo

I was looking for a way to easily run a kubernetes cluster on Windows and came across [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

This repo is a way for me to write down how I did it and hopefully help other people who may be interested in doing something similar.
