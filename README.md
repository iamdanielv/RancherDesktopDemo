# Rancher Desktop Demo

I was looking for a way to easily run a kubernetes cluster on Windows and Linux. I came across [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/).

This repo is a way for me to write down how I did it and hopefully help other people who may be interested in doing something similar.

There are two ways of installing Rancher Desktop in this repo:

1. [Windows](windows.md) (requires WSL 2)
2. [Ubuntu Linux](ubuntu.md)
